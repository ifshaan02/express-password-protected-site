# express-password-protected-site
A simple Express.js app with basic password protection that demonstrates middleware usage and serving static HTML pages.


This project is a simple Node.js and Express application that demonstrates how to protect routes with basic password authentication. It serves an index page where users can enter a password, and if the correct password (ILoveProgramming) is submitted, they gain access to a secret page. The app uses body-parser middleware to handle form data, a custom middleware function for password checking, and serves static HTML files for both the login and secret content. Itâ€™s a minimal example designed for learning middleware, request handling, and authentication basics in Express.
